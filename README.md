#### Disclaimer
Unfortunately, you will probably not be able to run the bot yourself. The database file is not tracked for privacy concerns and its structure is not defined properly in code. Recreating it can be time consuming.

This repository only exists for informational and memorial purposes. The code is not maintained and will not be worked on.
